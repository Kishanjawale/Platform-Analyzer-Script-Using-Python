The Python script performs a comprehensive analysis of the platform, capturing crucial information such as device details, 
processor specifications, core counts, RAM usage, and battery status. It generates a timestamped text file,
preserving the collected system data. Additionally, the script incorporates logging functionality, 
ensuring that detailed information, including successful execution and encountered errors, 
is recorded in a log file named "platform_analyzer.log" for further analysis and debugging.
